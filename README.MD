LiAni (libre anime) is an anime downloader, I dunno why I've named it this way I just thought it'd be cool.

# Installation
    - git clone https://github.com/Sliden101/liani.git
    - cd liani
    - npm i
    - sudo npm link
    - run liani in your terminal and enjoy!
# General Info
Liani downloads anime from https://ww4.gogoanimes.org and is heavily hardcoded, contributions will always be welcomed.

# Todo
- [ ] Progress Tracking
- [ ] Batch Download
- [ ] Fix reliance on 9anime2 since most new anime is on playgo
